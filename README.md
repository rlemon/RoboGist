Robo Gist is a gist injection manager. Very simple to use, just open the options page, feed it a gist ID, and a Regular Expression to match against the URLs you want to inject it on.  
If the gist ever updates it will be deactivated and the Robo Gist icon will look dead until you view it.  

  
 This project is still under heavy development and therefore is not on the chrome webstore yet.   
 To install a local copy download the source, install the deps, and run `npm run-script build`. After building you can load the unpacked extension (/build folder) from chrome://extensions
